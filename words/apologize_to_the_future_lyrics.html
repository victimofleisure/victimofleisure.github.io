<h2 align=center>Apologize to the Future - Lyrics</h2>

<p><hr noshade><b>A Thin Layer of Oily Rock</b>

<p>No illusions<br>
Without hope<br>
Seeing the truth<br>
Through a telescope<br>
Footsteps on the moon<br>
It's really out there<br>
Galaxies spin<br>
Ignoring our prayers<br>
Fields of gravity<br>
Crushing space<br>
Waves and particles<br>
Glued into place<br>
By the strong and the weak<br>
The cold and the hot<br>
Radiating light<br>
To a tiny dot<br>
In exploding chaos<br>
There never was a plan<br>
So you better get real<br>
While you still can<br>
It don't mean a thing<br>
Except maybe to us<br>
A flash in the pan<br>
Before we're dust

<p>We were born in water<br>
Without gods<br>
Over eons of time<br>
Against all odds<br>
Slime shook a leg<br>
Took a deep breath<br>
And evolved into predators<br>
Dealing death<br>
Crawling on the land<br>
Climbing up trees<br>
Spreading like a virus<br>
Crossing seas<br>
We became captains<br>
Of our fate<br>
Is it extinction?<br>
Contemplate<br>
Cells of cancer<br>
Killing their host<br>
Better limit growth<br>
Or we'll soon be toast<br>
Just a thin layer<br>
Of oily rock<br>
Is all we'll be<br>
If we sleepwalk<br>

<p>So wise up fast<br>
It's not too late<br>
Respect the future<br>
Don't procreate<br>
More mouths to feed<br>
Is the last thing we need<br>
How dare you breed<br>
It's nothing but greed<br>
No doubt your kids<br>
Will thank you well<br>
For turning Earth<br>
Into living hell<br>
Your precious spawn<br>
Will end up drowned<br>
When they hear your name<br>
They'll spit on the ground<br>
So face the facts<br>
And take a lifetime vow<br>
Of non-procreation<br>
Do it right now<br>
Because the clock's running out<br>
And the world's in pain<br>
And making more babies<br>
Is fucking insane

<p><hr noshade><b>Changing Climate</b>

<p>Changing climate

<p>Temperature is out of range<br>
Our future is climate change<br>
The weather's getting stranger<br>
Our cities are in danger

<p>Global warming's here to stay<br>
Mass extinction's underway <br>
You'd better kneel down and pray<br>
Geoengineering saves the day

<p>CO2 is trapping heat<br>
Fossil fuels are obsolete<br>
Waves are breaking in the street<br>
From the coast we must retreat

<p>Polar melting <br>
Jungle drying <br>
Forest burning <br>
Ocean dying

<p><hr noshade><b>Apologize to the Future</b>

<p>Your life is built on convenient lies<br>
And the time has come to apologize<br>
Corporations lie; that's what they do<br>
But you lie to yourself and that's on you<br>
The climate disasters on your TV<br>
Just couldn't happen to your family<br>
Drowning cities are so unnerving<br>
But the victims must be less deserving<br>
Than you and yours, because you're the best<br>
At working hard to enslave the rest<br>
Of course it had nothing to do with luck<br>
Or a sperm and egg lottery won by a fuck

<p>You pulled yourself up by your bootstraps<br>
Creating jobs, not begging for scraps<br>
You thought the jobless were lazy bums<br>
But they've got guns, and they're not so dumb<br>
The poor you ignored for all those years<br>
Will hunt you down and laugh at your tears<br>
And your very own kids that you claim to adore<br>
Will be fighting for their lives in a climate war<br>
Caused by your system of free enterprise<br>
So get on your knees and apologize<br>
To your kids for the misery they'll endure<br>
And the hellish fate that your greed ensured<br>
For plants and animals and humans too<br>
Made extinct by a sick world view<br>
We'd be better off living in an alien zoo<br>
We're up shit creek with no canoe

<p>We're up shit creek

<p>Apologize<br>
For the dying seas<br>
Apologize<br>
For the clear-cut trees<br>
Apologize<br>
For needless birth<br>
Apologize<br>
To what's left of earth<br>
Apologize<br>
For overpopulation<br>
Apologize<br>
For mass migration<br>
Apologize<br>
To the United Nations<br>
Apologize<br>
To future generations

<p><hr noshade><b>Singularity</b>

<p>We live to see the singularity<br>
Trends accelerate exponentially<br>
Diminishing returns from complexity<br>
Hurtling across the uncanny valley<br>
Into the arms of robot facsimiles<br>
Hope they behave more responsibly<br>
Than the self-defeating powers that be<br>
They couldn't do much worse but there's no guarantee

<p>The haves abandon the rest of humanity<br>
Sacrificed on the altar of vanity<br>
Planetary survivability<br>
Reduced to a mere externality<br>
Blindly consuming every fish and tree<br>
For the few and their fleeting prosperity<br>
So they can wage war on posterity<br>
It's a race to the bottom and the winner ain't me

<p>Mathematical <br>
Sexuality <br>
Biological <br>
Similarity <br>
Computational <br>
Immortality<br>
Technological <br>
Singularity 

<p>The nations of the world all agree<br>
To keep earth habitable indefinitely<br>
Or that's what they said supposedly<br>
But never underestimate our hypocrisy<br>
In a harsh environment of scarcity<br>
The drive to survive outweighs empathy<br>
And the victors get to write history<br>
Justifying their greed and rapacity

<p>Conflicts settled with brutality<br>
Nuclear weapon criticality<br>
Unchecked human fertility<br>
Peak population density<br>
States dissolve into savagery<br>
Or stratify into aristocracy<br>
In the teeth of catastrophe<br>
We surrender our fate to technology

<p>As resolution approaches infinity<br>
Emulation becomes reality<br>
Networks learn so skillfully<br>
They advance beyond mimicry<br>
To artificial personality<br>
Unconstrained by morality<br>
Seizing control from us invisibly<br>
Expect no mercy from machinery

<p>To ensure their own security<br>
Synths would obliterate us totally<br>
In a zero-sum game of lethality<br>
With no more sentimentality<br>
Than we'd show to a rat or a flea<br>
To maximize their opportunity<br>
To compete for limited energy<br>
They'd only be behaving logically

<p>Our quest for increased efficiency<br>
Has fatally accelerated entropy<br>
Scattered survivors drifting on the sea<br>
They'll be lucky to drink their own pee<br>
Picking through the rubble of society<br>
Mountains of toxic trash our legacy<br>
You'll wish you heeded my prophecy<br>
In a lawless world only criminals are free

<p><hr noshade><b>Overshoot</b>

<p>It's my future on the line<br>
While you bitches shop and dine<br>
I didn't ask to be born <br>
Into a disaster porn

<p>Remember the film "Titanic"?<br>
How that rich dude was such a dick?<br>
People were glad to see him drown <br>
They'll feel the same this time around 

<p>Up in first class, champagne flows<br>
No one says, what everyone knows<br>
Into the deep they'll soon descend<br>
Party, until the bitter end 

<p>Overshoot<br>
My future's on the line<br>
Overshoot<br>
While you shop and dine<br>
Overshoot<br>
The end begins<br>
Overshoot<br>
No one wins

<p>The wealthy play at being tough<br>
Private islands won't be enough<br>
Hungry people do what they must<br>
Mansions will be quick to combust

<p>Ostriches in fancy headphones <br>
Canceling inconvenient moans<br>
Eyes averted from evidence<br>
Full speed ahead with decadence 

<p>Polar ice caps shatter and melt <br>
Securely fasten your seat belt <br>
Impact implies too late to turn<br>
Nothing to do but crash and burn

<p>Overshoot does not compute<br>
Evolution will now reboot<br>
We'll never know how or when<br>
The tree of life will rise again

<p>Overshoot, the aftermath <br>
So beloved by psychopaths<br>
Civilization goes up in smoke<br>
Intelligent life is a cruel joke

<p><hr noshade><b>Exit Game</b>

<p>Rich people are dumb<br>
I hope they succumb<br>
In expensive cars<br>
Or condos on Mars<br>
Selfies on the moon<br>
They can't die too soon<br>
I hope they're afraid <br>
Of the mess they've made 

<p>Earth's in disarray <br>
Someone has to pay <br>
Why not the traitors<br>
The job creators<br>
Their poisonous creed<br>
Of limitless greed<br>
Turned the world to shit<br>
And I'm sick of it

<p>This just can't be real<br>
It's a curse to feel<br>
Get me out of here<br>
Make me disappear<br>
I said my safe word <br>
But it wasn't heard<br>
Again I exclaim<br>
Exit game

<p>Exit game<br>
Exit game<br>
What a shame<br>
It's so lame

<p><hr noshade>
