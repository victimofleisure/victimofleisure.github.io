<h3>Overshoot</h3>

<p>It's my future on the line<br>
While you bitches shop and dine<br>
I didn't ask to be born <br>
Into a disaster porn

<p>Remember the film "Titanic"?<br>
How that rich dude was such a dick?<br>
People were glad to see him drown <br>
They'll feel the same this time around 

<p>Up in first class, champagne flows<br>
No one says, what everyone knows<br>
Into the deep they'll soon descend<br>
Party, until the bitter end 

<p>Overshoot<br>
My future's on the line<br>
Overshoot<br>
While you shop and dine<br>
Overshoot<br>
The end begins<br>
Overshoot<br>
No one wins

<p>The wealthy play at being tough<br>
Private islands won't be enough<br>
Hungry people do what they must<br>
Mansions will be quick to combust

<p>Ostriches in fancy headphones <br>
Canceling inconvenient moans<br>
Eyes averted from evidence<br>
Full speed ahead with decadence 

<p>Polar ice caps shatter and melt <br>
Securely fasten your seat belt <br>
Impact implies too late to turn<br>
Nothing to do but crash and burn

<p>Overshoot does not compute<br>
Evolution will now reboot<br>
We'll never know how or when<br>
The tree of life will rise again

<p>Overshoot, the aftermath <br>
So beloved by psychopaths<br>
Civilization goes up in smoke<br>
Intelligent life is a cruel joke
