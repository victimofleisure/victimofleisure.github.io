<h3>Reptiles Like It Hot</h3>

<p>Shit's hitting the fan and I don't mean maybe<br>
Were you dropped on your head as a baby?<br>
You gonna wish you caught on a bit faster<br>
When you wake up in a climate disaster

<p>Why'd you let the planet get so warm?<br>
Throughout history, collapse is the norm<br>
Getting tired of saying this so many times<br>
History don't repeat but it sometimes rhymes

<p>Obviously we're sticking to the plan<br>
Burning fossil carbon as fast as we can<br>
We'll be living like animals, eat fuck kill<br>
That's where we're going if we drill baby drill

<p>Do you feel safe in your SUV?<br>
We'll be moving inland for a century<br>
Your house full of bling that was here to stay<br>
Dirty brown water gonna wash it away

<p>Don't act surprised that I'm so pissed<br>
You know damn well opportunities were missed<br>
Temperature's rising sooner than we feared<br>
'Cause you jerked off while the ice disappeared

<p>The rich party on, and try to get well<br>
But the rest get a first-class ticket to hell<br>
While I read the news in my gilded cage<br>
Is it any wonder that I'm filled with rage?

<p>I pee where I'm told to and wear my collar<br>
Just another slave to the almighty dollar<br>
My taxes pay for perpetual war<br>
It used to be a comedy, but not anymore

<p>You drive cars, have kids and eat meat<br>
So don't let me hear you whine about the heat<br>
I told you before, and I'm telling you again<br>
Extinction's coming, it's a matter of when

<p>Our richly deserved but tragic fate<br>
Arrives as our toxins accumulate<br>
The planet will be fine, but humans not<br>
On the bright side, reptiles like it hot
