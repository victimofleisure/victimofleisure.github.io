<h2>Chris Korda releases new EP &ldquo;Not My Problem I&rsquo;ll Be Dead&rdquo; on Yoyaku</h2>
<h3>March 16, 2023</h3>

<h1>Not My Problem, I&rsquo;ll Be Dead</h1>

<p>I wrote the &ldquo;Not My Problem, I&rsquo;ll Be Dead&rdquo; EP over a period of nine months, starting with &ldquo;Have a Good One&rdquo; in January 2022. It gradually dawned on me that I was writing the opposite of my 2020 album &ldquo;Apologize to the Future.&rdquo; I wanted to tell the other side of that album&rsquo;s story, the side I know best, having lived it.

<p>&ldquo;Apologize to the Future&rdquo; starts from the question &ldquo;how will future generations regard us?&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s told from the point of view of the victims, meaning young people, and especially people who haven&rsquo;t been born yet. Spoiler alert: They will bitterly resent us for causing the climate catastrophe and condemning them to Hell on Earth. Luckily our graves will be too far underwater to spit on.

<p>In contrast, &ldquo;Not My Problem, I&rsquo;ll Be Dead&rdquo; starts from the question &ldquo;how do present generations regard the future?&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s told from the point of view of the perpetrators. Yes, that means us. Another spoiler: Future generations are screwed, because we&rsquo;re much too busy partying and shopping and updating our profiles to worry about them. The planet&rsquo;s in trouble but we&rsquo;re having a lovely time!

<p>&ldquo;Baby Batter Bingo&rdquo; is influenced by the writings of French economist Thomas Piketty, and I hope he gets to hear it. Its protagonist brags about winning the genetic lottery and consuming champagne and caviar by the boatload in a new Gilded Age. For the uninitiated, &ldquo;baby batter&rdquo; is American slang for semen. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such thing as the common good&rdquo; is associated with Ayn Rand, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gonna stop me?&rdquo; is from self-obsessed Serbian artist Marina Abramovi?, and &ldquo;The little people&rdquo; refers to Leona Helmsley, who infamously said &ldquo;Only the little people pay taxes&rdquo; before being sent to prison for tax evasion.

<p>&ldquo;We played hardball, and you lost&rdquo; is what the police said to Rodney King after giving him the savage beating that sparked the 1992 Los Angeles riots. The chorus &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of winning&rdquo; mocks Donald Trump&lsquo;s 2016 campaign promise &ldquo;We're going to win so much, you may even get tired of winning.&rdquo; The neoliberal slogan &ldquo;A rising tide lifts all boats&rdquo; is juxtaposed with &ldquo;Cake gonna slide down their throats,&rdquo; echoing the apocryphal &ldquo;Let them eat cake" that epitomized aristocratic arrogance in pre-revolutionary France.
The title track was inspired by my father, who has ended many discussions of climate change with the words &ldquo;not my problem, I&rsquo;ll be dead.&rdquo; Last Christmas I gave him a T-shirt emblazoned with King Louis XV&rsquo;s timeless quote &ldquo;Apr&egrave;s moi, le deluge&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m sure he wears it proudly.

<p>&ldquo;Have a Good One&rdquo; is a caricature of smugness and entitlement. It also lampoons astrology, which I despise because it&rsquo;s disempowering and based on a cosmology that was proved false in the early 16th century. The refrain &ldquo;The heart wants what it wants&rdquo; is associated with Woody Allen&rsquo;s paraphilia, but was originally penned by Emily Dickinson.

<p>I wrote &ldquo;Awesome on Mars&rdquo; in a taxi on the way from Vienna airport to a hotel. Such is DJ life. The song was inspired by Elon Musk&rsquo;s enthusiasm for colonizing Mars. He was the world&rsquo;s richest person at the time, and since the rich love ostentatious displays of wealth, I pictured him replicating Las Vegas on Mars, complete with a miniature Eiffel Tower. Of course there&rsquo;d be a statue of him in the spaceport. &ldquo;Cruise the strip in electric hover cars&rdquo; satirizes both technological utopianism and Musk&rsquo;s car company.

<p>The &ldquo;Not My Problem, I&rsquo;ll Be Dead&rdquo; EP seethes with brutal parody and has been compared to the work of 16th-century French iconoclast Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais. Like &ldquo;Apologize to the Future&rdquo; it&rsquo;s vocal-heavy and mostly in rhyme, but it&rsquo;s more up-tempo and dancefloor friendly. Though all tracks are in complex polymeter as usual, they have predominant time signatures, with &ldquo;Baby Batter Bingo&rdquo; in 4/4 and 3/4, &ldquo;Not My Problem, I&rsquo;ll Be Dead&rdquo; in 17/4, &ldquo;Have a Good One&rdquo; in 5/4, and &ldquo;Awesome on Mars&rdquo; in 35/4.
