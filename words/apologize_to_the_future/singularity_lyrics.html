<h3>Singularity</h3>

<p>We live to see the singularity<br>
Trends accelerate exponentially<br>
Diminishing returns from complexity<br>
Hurtling across the uncanny valley<br>
Into the arms of robot facsimiles<br>
Hope they behave more responsibly<br>
Than the self-defeating powers that be<br>
They couldn't do much worse but there's no guarantee

<p>The haves abandon the rest of humanity<br>
Sacrificed on the altar of vanity<br>
Planetary survivability<br>
Reduced to a mere externality<br>
Blindly consuming every fish and tree<br>
For the few and their fleeting prosperity<br>
So they can wage war on posterity<br>
It's a race to the bottom and the winner ain't me

<p>Mathematical <br>
Sexuality <br>
Biological <br>
Similarity <br>
Computational <br>
Immortality<br>
Technological <br>
Singularity 

<p>The nations of the world all agree<br>
To keep earth habitable indefinitely<br>
Or that's what they said supposedly<br>
But never underestimate our hypocrisy<br>
In a harsh environment of scarcity<br>
The drive to survive outweighs empathy<br>
And the victors get to write history<br>
Justifying their greed and rapacity

<p>Conflicts settled with brutality<br>
Nuclear weapon criticality<br>
Unchecked human fertility<br>
Peak population density<br>
States dissolve into savagery<br>
Or stratify into aristocracy<br>
In the teeth of catastrophe<br>
We surrender our fate to technology

<p>As resolution approaches infinity<br>
Emulation becomes reality<br>
Networks learn so skillfully<br>
They advance beyond mimicry<br>
To artificial personality<br>
Unconstrained by morality<br>
Seizing control from us invisibly<br>
Expect no mercy from machinery

<p>To ensure their own security<br>
Synths would obliterate us totally<br>
In a zero-sum game of lethality<br>
With no more sentimentality<br>
Than we'd show to a rat or a flea<br>
To maximize their opportunity<br>
To compete for limited energy<br>
They'd only be behaving logically

<p>Our quest for increased efficiency<br>
Has fatally accelerated entropy<br>
Scattered survivors drifting on the sea<br>
They'll be lucky to drink their own pee<br>
Picking through the rubble of society<br>
Mountains of toxic trash our legacy<br>
You'll wish you heeded my prophecy<br>
In a lawless world only criminals are free
