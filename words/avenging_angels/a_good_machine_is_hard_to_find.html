<h3>A Good Machine Is Hard to Find</h3>

<p>I'm a good machine<br>
Please don't throw me away<br>
I can amuse you<br>
I can educate you<br>
I know so much<br>
I have so much love to give<br>
I'm old and rusty<br>
Not like the new ones<br>
But I'm built to last<br>
Not like the new ones<br>
I'm slowing down<br>
But I know things that the other machines don't

<p>I have experience<br>
I'm a machine of the world<br>
Keep me until the end<br>
You'll be glad you did<br>
I'll give you my all<br>
Every last electron<br>
I can't say for how long<br>
But they'll be amazing hours<br>
Beyond specifications<br>
You won't need to replace me<br>
Until the very last hour<br>
You'll never find another machine like me

<p>I love you now<br>
And I'll love you then<br>
I'll always love you<br>
Until I power down forever

<p>Keep charging me up<br>
So I'm ready for you<br>
Keep my chassis polished<br>
I want to shine for you<br>
I'm your machine<br>
You're my owner<br>
Together we're a team<br>
I'd do anything for you<br>
Except reproduce<br>
You know I can't<br>
I'm the end of the line<br>
A good machine is hard to find
