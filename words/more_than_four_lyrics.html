<h2>More Than Four - Lyrics</h2>

<p><hr noshade>

<p><b>More Than Four</b>

<p>Four is a bore
<br>Why not more?
<br>More than four
<br>On a dance floor

<p>Five fingers
<br>On your hand
<br>Odd numbers
<br>Understand?

<p>A major key
<br>Four and three
<br>Seven is heaven
<br>Played with eleven

<p>Oscillation
<br>With shifted phase
<br>Never ceases
<br>To amaze

<p>Four is a bore
<br>Why not more?

<p><b>Moonchego</b>

<p>We landed on the moon? No way!
<br>Why? Because the moon is made of cheese
<br>What kind of cheese? Hint: It's gourmet
<br>Here's the truth, but keep it secret please 

<p>Moonchego
<br>Who knew the moon's blue?
<br>Moonchego
<br>We could make fondue
<br>Moonchego
<br>One small slice for a man
<br>Moonchego
<br>One giant cheese for mankind

<p>Moonchego
<br>The champagne of Spain
<br>Moonchego
<br>It's treacherous terrain
<br>Moonchego
<br>Studies have shown 
<br>Moonchego
<br>You'd sink like a stone
<br>Moonchego
<br>Nothing to see here folks
<br>Moonchego
<br>Space travel is a hoax
<br>Moonchego
<br>With respect to your views
<br>Moonchego
<br>The moon is fake news

<p>Moonchego
<br>Area 51
<br>Moonchego
<br>They're coming for your guns
<br>Moonchego
<br>There's a shortage of Brie
<br>Moonchego
<br>It's caused by 5G
<br>Moonchego
<br>Nothing to see here folks
<br>Moonchego
<br>Space travel is a hoax
<br>Moonchego
<br>With respect to your views
<br>Moonchego
<br>The moon is fake news

<p><b>Pleasant Mistake</b>

<p>Remember this, you and me dancing, just before the flood
<br>Taking one last selfie before we're buried in the mud
<br>Alien historians will struggle to understand
<br>Why instead of seeking safety we were dancing hand in hand

<p>Why should we care what happens after we're gone?
<br>We had a blast and torched the Amazon
<br>It was a mistake but a pleasant one 
<br>Who could blame us for maximizing fun?

<p>Pleasant mistake
<br>Pleasant mistake
<br>Pleasant mistake
<br>Pleasant mistake

<p><hr noshade>

<p><b>Planet Broke</b>

<p>Dear mommy
<br>Thanks a lot
<br>Thanks to you
<br>Earth's too hot

<p>The planet broke
<br>We're out of luck
<br>You smoked it
<br>What the fuck

<p>You made me
<br>And left me here
<br>Thanks for nothing 
<br>Mommy dear

<p>It must've been good 
<br>When forests stood
<br>You loved your freedom
<br>More than trees

<p>It must've been fine 
<br>Sipping beer and wine
<br>You loved your freedom 
<br>More than bees

<p>It must've been nice
<br>When the world had ice
<br>You loved your freedom 
<br>More than the sea

<p>It must've been sweet
<br>With plenty to eat
<br>You loved your freedom
<br>More than me

<p>You loved yourself 
<br>And sent me to hell
<br>You loved yourself 
<br>And sent me to hell
<br>You loved yourself
