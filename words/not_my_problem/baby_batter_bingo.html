<h3>Baby Batter Bingo</h3>

<p>I was born and raised to be a tycoon<br>
My mamma fed me with a golden spoon<br>
I could've been born a slave, but I wasn't<br>
I want a luxurious life, and who doesn't?

<p>There's no such thing as the common good<br>
Who's gonna stop me? You wish you could<br>
The aristocracy is alive and well<br>
The little people can go to hell

<p>Baby batter bingo<br>
My number won<br>
Zygote blackjack<br>
I got twenty-one<br>
Chromosome roulette<br>
God smiled on me<br>
The chips are down<br>
In the land of the free

<p>Genetic lottery<br>
I'm a winner!<br>
Wheel of fortune<br>
Where's my dinner?<br>
You lost the game<br>
Of sperm and egg<br>
The best part of you<br>
Ran down daddy's leg

<p>This world wasn't built by magical elves<br>
It's one against all, and all for themselves<br>
We play to win, whatever the cost<br>
We played hardball, and you lost

<p>Freedom's just another word for money<br>
We're having another Gilded Age, honey<br>
Champagne and caviar by the boatload<br>
Feeling triggered? Glue yourself to the road!

<p>I won, I won, I won, I won, I won<br>
I won, I won, I won, I won, I won, I won<br>
I'm tired of winning

<p>A rising tide lifts all boats<br>
Cake gonna slide down their throats<br>
Lower taxes gonna please us<br>
Anti-vaxes, guns and Jesus

<p>Sweet delight<br>
Every night<br>
Creamy white<br>
Baby batter bingo
