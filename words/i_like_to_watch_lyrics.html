<p><h2 align=center>I Like to Watch - Lyrics</h2>

<p><p><hr noshade>

<p>I put my hand in my pocket<br>
What do I feel<br>
One hundred and ten stories<br>
Of concrete and steel<br>
I like to watch

<p>That plane-shaped hole<br>
Really gets me hot<br>
But the big ball of fire<br>
Is the money shot<br>
I like to watch

<p>I like to watch<br>
The plane going in<br>
I like to watch<br>
The flame shooting out<br>
People dive into the street<br>
While I play with my meat<br>
My steel melted<br>
and my tower's coming down

<p>The New York skyline<br>
Will never be the same<br>
But the guys who flew those planes<br>
Had fucking amazing aim<br>
I like to watch

<p>There must have been a reason<br>
But I don't understand<br>
Why they hit the Pentagon<br>
Instead of Disneyland<br>
I like to watch

<p>I like to watch<br>
The plane going in<br>
I like to watch<br>
The flame shooting out<br>
It's raining broken glass<br>
While I sit on my ass<br>
My steel melted<br>
and my tower's coming down

<p>I'd almost had enough<br>
Of watching planes explode<br>
Until they showed it in reverse<br>
And I had to shoot my load<br>
I like to watch

<p>Now my hand's all sticky<br>
And I can't find a rag<br>
I guess I'll have to use<br>
The american flag<br>
I like to watch
