<h3>Exit Game</h3>

<p>Rich people are dumb<br>
I hope they succumb<br>
In expensive cars<br>
Or condos on Mars<br>
Selfies on the moon<br>
They can't die too soon<br>
I hope they're afraid <br>
Of the mess they've made 

<p>Earth's in disarray <br>
Someone has to pay <br>
Why not the traitors<br>
The job creators<br>
Their poisonous creed<br>
Of limitless greed<br>
Turned the world to shit<br>
And I'm sick of it

<p>This just can't be real<br>
It's a curse to feel<br>
Get me out of here<br>
Make me disappear<br>
I said my safe word <br>
But it wasn't heard<br>
Again I exclaim<br>
Exit game

<p>Exit game<br>
Exit game<br>
What a shame<br>
It's so lame
