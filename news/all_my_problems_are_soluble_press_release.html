<h2>All My Problems Are Soluble</h2>

<p>Chris Korda’s new album “All My Problems Are Soluble” features nine harmonically and rhythmically sophisticated instrumentals for orchestral strings, guitar, piano, and occasional reed organ. Drawing from contemporary classical, jazz, and folk influences, the compositions employ complex polymeter, a technique that produces intricate patterns by playing in multiple time signatures simultaneously.

<p>Inspired by philosopher Sean Carroll’s concept of “ekinology”—the idea that things evolve from their predecessors rather than following a predetermined path—the album reflects an incremental, iterative approach to musical development.

<p>The album’s theme is storms and flooding, mirroring the increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation due to climate change. This is expressed through gradually changing harmonies and flowing melodic lines that evoke the transformative power of nature.

<p>In addition to utilizing Korda’s custom Polymeter MIDI Sequencer—freely available to the public—the album incorporates a groundbreaking system for creating consonant twelve-tone chord progressions. This innovative approach adds a distinctive harmonic texture to tracks 2, 3, 6, and 9.

<p>Korda pioneered the use of polymeter in electronic dance music in the 1990s and has released on labels such as International Deejay Gigolo, Perlon, Mental Groove, Yoyaku, and Slacker 85. Korda’s previous release “Avenging Angels of Software” explored artificial intelligence and humanity’s future.

<p>Trained as a jazz guitarist and software designer, Korda crafts rules-based systems for generative music, which are related to the “light art” machines of Thomas Wilfred. Korda also makes visual art and recently had a solo exhibition at Kölnischer Kunstverein.

<p>Set for release on January 31, 2025 via Kevorkian Records (Catalog #8), “All My Problems Are Soluble” includes the following tracks:

<p><ol>
<li>Water Ground Fine
<li>Gathering Into Form
