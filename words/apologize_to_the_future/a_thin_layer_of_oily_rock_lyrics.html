<h3>A Thin Layer of Oily Rock</h3>

<p>No illusions<br>
Without hope<br>
Seeing the truth<br>
Through a telescope<br>
Footsteps on the moon<br>
It's really out there<br>
Galaxies spin<br>
Ignoring our prayers<br>
Fields of gravity<br>
Crushing space<br>
Waves and particles<br>
Glued into place<br>
By the strong and the weak<br>
The cold and the hot<br>
Radiating light<br>
To a tiny dot<br>
In exploding chaos<br>
There never was a plan<br>
So you better get real<br>
While you still can<br>
It don't mean a thing<br>
Except maybe to us<br>
A flash in the pan<br>
Before we're dust

<p>We were born in water<br>
Without gods<br>
Over eons of time<br>
Against all odds<br>
Slime shook a leg<br>
Took a deep breath<br>
And evolved into predators<br>
Dealing death<br>
Crawling on the land<br>
Climbing up trees<br>
Spreading like a virus<br>
Crossing seas<br>
We became captains<br>
Of our fate<br>
Is it extinction?<br>
Contemplate<br>
Cells of cancer<br>
Killing their host<br>
Better limit growth<br>
Or we'll soon be toast<br>
Just a thin layer<br>
Of oily rock<br>
Is all we'll be<br>
If we sleepwalk<br>

<p>So wise up fast<br>
It's not too late<br>
Respect the future<br>
Don't procreate<br>
More mouths to feed<br>
Is the last thing we need<br>
How dare you breed<br>
It's nothing but greed<br>
No doubt your kids<br>
Will thank you well<br>
For turning Earth<br>
Into living hell<br>
Your precious spawn<br>
Will end up drowned<br>
When they hear your name<br>
They'll spit on the ground<br>
So face the facts<br>
And take a lifetime vow<br>
Of non-procreation<br>
Do it right now<br>
Because the clock's running out<br>
And the world's in pain<br>
And making more babies<br>
Is fucking insane
