<h3>Apologize to the Future</h3>

<p>Your life is built on convenient lies<br>
And the time has come to apologize<br>
Corporations lie; that's what they do<br>
But you lie to yourself and that's on you<br>
The climate disasters on your TV<br>
Just couldn't happen to your family<br>
Drowning cities are so unnerving<br>
But the victims must be less deserving<br>
Than you and yours, because you're the best<br>
At working hard to enslave the rest<br>
Of course it had nothing to do with luck<br>
Or a sperm and egg lottery won by a fuck

<p>You pulled yourself up by your bootstraps<br>
Creating jobs, not begging for scraps<br>
You thought the jobless were lazy bums<br>
But they've got guns, and they're not so dumb<br>
The poor you ignored for all those years<br>
Will hunt you down and laugh at your tears<br>
And your very own kids that you claim to adore<br>
Will be fighting for their lives in a climate war<br>
Caused by your system of free enterprise<br>
So get on your knees and apologize<br>
To your kids for the misery they'll endure<br>
And the hellish fate that your greed ensured<br>
For plants and animals and humans too<br>
Made extinct by a sick world view<br>
We'd be better off living in an alien zoo<br>
We're up shit creek with no canoe

<p>We're up shit creek

<p>Apologize<br>
For the dying seas<br>
Apologize<br>
For the clear-cut trees<br>
Apologize<br>
For needless birth<br>
Apologize<br>
To what's left of earth<br>
Apologize<br>
For overpopulation<br>
Apologize<br>
For mass migration<br>
Apologize<br>
To the United Nations<br>
Apologize<br>
To future generations
