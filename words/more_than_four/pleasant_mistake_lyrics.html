<h3>Pleasant Mistake</h3>

<p>Remember this, you and me dancing, just before the flood
<br>Taking one last selfie before we're buried in the mud
<br>Alien historians will struggle to understand
<br>Why instead of seeking safety we were dancing hand in hand

<p>Why should we care what happens after we're gone?
<br>We had a blast and torched the Amazon
<br>It was a mistake but a pleasant one 
<br>Who could blame us for maximizing fun?

<p>Pleasant mistake
<br>Pleasant mistake
<br>Pleasant mistake
<br>Pleasant mistake
