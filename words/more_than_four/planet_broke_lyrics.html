<h3>Planet Broke</h3>

<p>Dear mommy
<br>Thanks a lot
<br>Thanks to you
<br>Earth's too hot

<p>The planet broke
<br>We're out of luck
<br>You smoked it
<br>What the fuck

<p>You made me
<br>And left me here
<br>Thanks for nothing 
<br>Mommy dear

<p>It must've been good 
<br>When forests stood
<br>You loved your freedom
<br>More than trees

<p>It must've been fine 
<br>Sipping beer and wine
<br>You loved your freedom 
<br>More than bees

<p>It must've been nice
<br>When the world had ice
<br>You loved your freedom 
<br>More than the sea

<p>It must've been sweet
<br>With plenty to eat
<br>You loved your freedom
<br>More than me

<p>You loved yourself 
<br>And sent me to hell
<br>You loved yourself 
<br>And sent me to hell
<br>You loved yourself
