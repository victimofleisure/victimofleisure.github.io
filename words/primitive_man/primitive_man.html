<h3>Primitive Man</h3>

<p>I thought it was a monkey 
<br>It's covered in hair
<br>It smells wicked funky
<br>Its bottom is bare

<p>Look at how it walks
<br>Knuckles on the ground
<br>I think it's trying to talk
<br>It makes a freaky sound

<p>Primitive man
<br>Primitive man
<br>Primitive man
<br>I thought it was a monkey 

<p>I wish I knew what it's trying to say
<br>It's rocking Neanderthal DNA
<br>Very athletic but struggles with math
<br>Whatever it is, it sure needs a bath

<p>It's yelling at me 
<br>I gotta stay calm 
<br>It's having a pee
<br>It looks like your mom

<p>It comes from the savanna 
<br>It's got a monobrow
<br>It's peeling a banana
<br>I better run right now 

<p>Primitive man
<br>Primitive man
<br>Primitive man
<br>I thought it was a monkey 

<p>Time to learn city ways, my furry friend
<br>Pull a pair of pants over your rear end
<br>No more swinging from trees, you're done with that
<br>Sit down, watch TV, drink beer and get fat

<p>Just stick this up your nose, hold your other nostril shut, and sniff! Watch me do it first. 
<br>[snort] Ok, now you. [snort] There you go! Nice one! Ain't civilization great?

<p>You swipe your card
<br>Come on, be brave
<br>It's not so hard
<br>You need a shave

<p>Remember your PIN
<br>Be a wage slave
<br>Move to Berlin
<br>Dance at a rave

<p>Primitive man
<br>Primitive man
<br>Primitive man
<br>I thought it was a monkey
